# BoxNav

![](demo.gif)

A simple playground for making an agent navigate around some directed corridors represented as overlapping boxes.

Kick off the simulation with:

~~~bash
python boxsim.py mp4
~~~

Right-handed coordinate system.

- Up-Down is y relative to Oldenborg
- Left-right is x relative to Oldenborg


Things to do:

- Document code
- Add box to box navigation for boy scout (move to next target)
- Implement wanderer navigator
- Create environment using Oldenborg values from Liz (find spreadsheet on Slack)
